# General information
[Please see exercises instruction page on Canvas](https://kth.instructure.com/courses/6156/pages/exercises-quizzes)

All the exercises are written and tested in Python 2, which is dificullt to switch to Python 3 totally. So if you are using Python 3 usually, I would recommend to use Pyenv or Virtualenv to setup a local Python 2 environment.
Regarding python modules, some exercises will require more modules, you could use pip/easy_install to install them. For Windows users, you might need [prebuilt binaries](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto).
